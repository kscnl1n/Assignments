# Assignments
This repository is self-explanatory. As a computer science undegraduate student, I have taken many programming classes throughout the course of my education, and I wanted a place to keep track of them.

**Courses:**
**COSC 1436** - Programming fundamentals - The very basics of C++ over concepts such as variables, arrays, functions, and loops. Taken Fall 2023.

**COSC 1437** - Programming fundamentals - More advanced elements of C++ brushing over classes, inheritance, templates, polymorphism, and namespaces. Taken Spring 2024.
